# DSA1-MiniProject : Messager

We have made a very simple version of gmail using C++. In our program, an user can create an account, login and send a message to another existing user. User while logged-in in can view list of received, sent, deleted, starred messages and can also search for messages sent to/ received from an user. For every sent/ received message user can read it, delete it, mark it as important (star)/unstar. Deleted messages have been stored in a vector (trash). User can either permanently delete message from trash or simply view it. We have used a doubly linked list to store user accounts and two singly linked list per user to store sent and received messages.
